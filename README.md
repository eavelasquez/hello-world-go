# hello-world-go

This repository contains examples of Go fundamentals. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. It's a fast, statically type, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

The examples found here were developed from the [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/) in the tutorials section.
